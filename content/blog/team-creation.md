It started at the Robotics Student Association, when we realized that, somehow, TU Delft did not have a RoboCup team. We saw this competition as a great opportunity for research and innovation in the field of robotics, and it also seemed like a lot of fun !

This project started to take shape at the start of the academic year, with 5 new RSA members joining the team.

We still have a long way to go, but we already have a goal : to be qualified for the RoboCup championship in Eindhoven in 2024.
