[{"content":"This Sunday, we travelled to Enschede to visit another RoboCup team, RoboTeam Twente.\nThey are a team with 7 years of experience, and were very willing to help us start our team. We talked about many different aspects of the competition, from managing the team to building the robots and setting up the software stack. After getting to know each other, they presented their team, history and robots. We spent the rest of the afternoon discussing a lot of subjects, discovering their amazing workshop and even controlling one of their robots.\nWe would like to greatly thank the team for all the help they provided, and we hope to collaborate even more in the future !\n","permalink":"https://roboteamtud.github.io/blog/visit-twente/","summary":"This Sunday, we travelled to Enschede to visit another RoboCup team, RoboTeam Twente","title":"Visit to RoboTeam Twente"},{"content":"It started at the Robotics Student Association, when we realized that, somehow, TU Delft did not have a RoboCup team.

It aims to promote science and engineering research, with the ultimate goal being to develop robots that can beat human players :\nBy the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup.\nWe are competing in the Small Size League, in which teams of 6 robots compete against each other in 10-minute matches\nRoboCup Small Size League robot soccer focuses on the problem of intelligent multi-agent cooperation and control in a highly dynamic environment with a hybrid centralized/distributed system.\nEach robot must conform to the dimensions as specified in the F180 rules: the robot must fit within an 180 mm diameter circle and must be no higher than 15 cm. The robots play soccer with an orange golf ball on a green carpeted field that is about 12 m long by 9 m wide.\nAll objects on the field are tracked by a standardized vision system that processes the data provided by multiple cameras that are attached to a camera bar located about 4 m above the playing surface.\nBuilding a successful team requires clever design, implementation and integration of many hardware and software sub-components into a robustly functioning whole making Small Size robot soccer a very interesting and challenging domain for research and education.\n- From the Robocup website\nGallery ","permalink":"https://roboteamtud.github.io/about/","summary":"About our team The insert name here team was formed in September 2022, as a project from the Robotics Student Association in Delft.
