      <description>It started at the Robotics Student Association, when we realized that, somehow, TU Delft did not have a RoboCup team. We saw this competition as a great opportunity for research and innovation in the field of robotics, and it also seemed like a lot of fun !
This project started to take shape at the start of the academic year, with 5 new RSA members joining the team.
We still have a long way to go, but we already have a goal : to be qualified for the RoboCup championship in Eindhoven in 2024.</description>

      <description>About our team The insert name here team was formed in September 2022, as a project from the Robotics Student Association in Delft. We currently have 8 members, meeting regularly and working on all aspects of the project, including management, software, hardware and electronics. We are a multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary team, with many dutch and international students in Robotics, Computer Science, Nanobiology, and more.
We aim to participate in the 2024 RoboCup competition in Eindhoven, and we are working hard to get the robots ready !</description>

Alexander Hardware I&amp;rsquo;ve come from France to study Computer Science in Delft, joining the team because of the interest in Robotics I gained from participating in the First Tech Challenge as a high-school student.
